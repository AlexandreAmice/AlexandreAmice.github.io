One of the most important subroutines in collision-free motion planning is collision detection, which has been studied extensively. Algorithms for checking whether a single configuration is collision free are quite mature and can be performed in microseconds on modern hardware.\nBy contrast, algorithms which are capable of certifying non-collision for the infinite family of configurations along a motion plan are less common. Known as dynamic collision checking, this subroutine is performed hundreds to thousands of times in randomized motion planning methods, and so the speed as well as the correctness of these algorithms is central to their adoption. Due to the speed requirement, it is common practice to heuristically perform dynamic collision checking by sampling a finite number of static configurations along the motion plan. Nevertheless, it is widely recognized that this is insufficient for safety critical robots.\nCurrent methods for formally checking the safety of robots frequently only apply to piecewise linear motion plans and are either too slow for practical deployment, rely on difficult to acquire parameters, or are too conservative for certifying motion plans in tight spaces.\nContribution In this work, we provide a method for certifying that a robot trajectory contains no collisions. The method provides rigorous proofs of non-collision using Sums-of-Squares optimization, can certify piecewise-polyonmial paths of arbitrary degree, and is efficient enough to certify the safety of a bimanual manipulator motion plan in just over a second. Moreover, it is efficient enough to discriminate the safety of two motion plans which differ by only millimeters.\nVisualizing the Certificates The certificates of non-collision can be visualized as hyperplanes in the task space.

This approach gives a “negative” description of C-free, describing it as the complement of this configuration space obstacle.\nNonetheless, many optimization-based motion planning frameworks can benefit greatly from a “positive” description of C-free, where in C-free is described as the union of simpler, often convex, sets. While it is possible to check for collisions at a point using standard algorithms, to date no practical method exists for computing C-free regions with rigorous certificates due to the complexity of mapping task-space obstacles through the kinematics. Therefore, the current literature provides no method for providing a positive description of C-free for these motion planning methods.\nContribution In this work, we provide a method for describing C-free using convex polyhedra in a bijective, rational parametrization of C-space known as the tangent configuration space (TC-space). Our primary technical contributions are two convex (specifically Sums-of-Squares (SOS)) programs which can certify that a polyhedron in TC-space contains no collision when the obstacles are specified as convex sets in task space. Similar to (Deits et al. 2014), we then construct certified, collision-free polytopic regions by alternating between a pair of convex programs. Our method works in arbitrary dimensions and is the first to our knowledge to provide rigorous certificates for non-zero volume sets in this setting. Moreover, we provide a fast, mature implementation of our technique in the open-source robotics toolbox Drake.\nResults We run our method on robots of varying complexity. Visit this link to play with a variety of these examples yourself!\nA Two Dimensional Example We consider a simple two degree of freedom robot where we can visualize both the task space on the left and the configuration space obstacle on the right. The green dot in the configuration space represents the current configuration. The red region corresponds to the configuration space obstacle, i.e. if the green dot wanders into the red region we have a collision. We animate a trajectory through our certified region and show the separating plane certificates for the tips of the two robots. The animation can be replayed by opening the control menu and hitting play on the animation (you may need to minimize the scene tab).\nname=\u0026#34;pinball_trajectory\u0026#34; View this animation in full screen\nWe also provide a visualization of our algorithm growing regions in this configuration space below.\nname=\u0026#34;pinball_trajectory\u0026#34; View this animation in full screen\nA Realistic Robot Our work scales to various realistic robots.

They proposed particular learning objectives which attempt to reconstruct the cost and next state and provide a bound on the suboptimality of the closed-loop performance, but it is unclear whether these bounds are tight or actually lead to good performance in practice.  Here we study this methodology by examining the special case of discrete approximate information states (DAIS). In this setting, we can solve for the globally optimal policy using value iteration for the DAIS model, allowing us to disambiguate the performance of the AIS objective from the policy search. Going further, for small problems with finite information states, we reformulate the DAIS learning problem as a novel mixed-integer program (MIP) and solve it to its global optimum; in the infinite information states case, we introduce clustering-based and end-to-end gradient-based optimization methods for minimizing the DAIS construction loss. We study DAIS in three partially observable environments and find that the AIS objective offers relatively loose bounds for guaranteeing monotonic performance improvement and is sufficient but not necessary for implementing optimal controllers. DAIS may even prove useful in practice by itself or as part of mixed discrete- and continuous-state representations, due to its ability to represent logical state, to its potential interpretabilty, and to the availability of these stronger algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Discrete Approximate Information States in Partially Observable Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Amice*","Hongkai Dai*","Peter Werner","Annan Zhang","Russ Tedrake"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676494016,"objectID":"ce3d466255ea4631a0e522309bec13ec","permalink":"https://alexandreamice.github.io/publication/amice-2022-finding/","publishdate":"2023-02-15T20:46:56.569204Z","relpermalink":"/publication/amice-2022-finding/","section":"publication","summary":" Configuration space (C-space) has played a central role in collision-free motion planning, particularly for robot manipulators.

Surprisingly, many problems such as balancing bipedal robots, designing your own index fund, and allocating power in the energy grid can be formulated as convex optimization problems. Convex optimization is a mature technology which can be used to solve a huge number of applied problems and can be scaled to problems with millions of variables. However, recognizing what can be transformed into a convex optimization problem can be challenging. This course will teach you how to recognize, formulate, and solve these problems.\nLectures will be motivated by realistic case studies from areas where convex optimization is used in practice. We will briefly survey theoretical results in convex analysis, but the majority of the course will focus on formulating and solving problems that come up in practice. Applications will include robotics, signal processing, statistics and machine learning, finance, control, power systems, and other areas based on student interest. This course is designed for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students.\nCourse objectives learn to recognize and formulate convex optimization problems that appear in various fields. become comfortable using open source software to solve these optimization problems. develop insight to decide which solver is best for your problem. give students the background needed to feel comfortable in applying these methods in their own research work and/or applications About the Course Prerequisites Comfort with multivariable calculus (18.02) and linear algebra (18.06) as well as basic programming in Python or Julia. Familiarity with basic probability and/or controls will aid in understanding many of the case studies.\nIntended audience Anyone who expects to use optimization as a tool for scientific computing. Beginning graduate and advanced undergraduate students are the particular target audience.\nSchedule The following schedule is tentative and subject to change. See Syllabus for in depth topic list.

Problem sets will focus on giving students practice formulating convex optimization problems and obtaining familiarity with solving those programs using open source software.\nEach problem set will ask you to model and solve convex optimization problems that come from various application areas, which will be chosen based on interests of the class. Problem sets will require use of the Julia or Python programming languages, but no prior experience in either is required. Problem sets are expected to take around 4 hours each.\nProject There will be a course project during the last week of IAP that will allow you to apply convex optimization to a problem of interest. The final product will be a short mathematical description of this problem (akin to the descriptions you see on the problem sets) and a solution. Course grading is designed such that this project can take the place of the final problem set.

When budget or operational constraints are imposed on the schedule, this problem is in general NP-hard and its solution can therefore only be approximated even for moderately large systems. The quality of this approximation depends on the structure of both the constraints and the objective. This work shows that greedy scheduling is near-optimal when the constraints can be represented as an intersection of matroids, algebraic structures that encode requirements such as limits on the number of agents deployed per time slot, total number of actuator uses, and duty cycle restrictions. To do so, it proves that the LQG cost function is a-supermodular and provides a new a/(a + P )-optimality certificates for the greedy minimization of such functions over an intersections of P matroids. These certificates are shown to approach the 1/(1 + P ) guarantee of supermodular functions in relevant settings. These results support the use of greedy algorithms in non-supermodular quadratic control problems as opposed to typical heuristics such as convex relaxations and surrogate figures of merit, e.g., the log det of the controllability Gramian.","tags":[],"title":"Approximately supermodular scheduling subject to matroid constraints","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Amice","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Yet, planning for every contingency can lead to over-conservative, poorly performing solutions or even, in extreme cases, to infeasibility. Resilience addresses these shortcomings by adapting the underlying control problem, e.g., by relaxing its specifications, to obtain a feasible, possibly still valuable trajectory. Despite their different aspects, robustness and resilience are often conflated in the context of dynamical systems and control. The goal of this paper is to formalize, in the context of optimal control, the concept of resilience understood as above, i.e., in terms of adaptation. To do so, we introduce a resilient formulation of optimal control by allowing disruption-dependent modifications of the requirements that induce the desired resilient behavior. We then propose a framework to design these behaviors automatically by trading off control performance and requirement violations. We analyze this resilience-by-compromise method to obtain inverse optimality results and quantify the effect of disturbances on the induced requirement relaxations. By proving that robustness and resilience optimize different objectives, we show that these are in fact distinct system properties.

You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

In general, this problem is NP-hard and its solution can therefore only be approximated even for moderately large systems. Although convex relaxations have been used to obtain these approximations, they do not come with performance guarantees. Another common approach is to use greedy search. Still, classical guarantees do not hold for the scheduling problem because the LQR cost function is neither submodular nor supermodular. Though surrogate supermodular figures of merit, such as the log det of the controllability Gramian, are often used as a workaround, the resulting problem is not equivalent to the original LQR one. This work shows that no change to the original problem is needed to obtain performance guarantees. Specifically, it proves that the LQR cost function is approximately supermodular and provides new near-optimality certificates for the greedy minimization of these functions over a generic matroid. These certificates are shown to approach the classical 1/2 guarantee of supermodular functions in relevant application scenarios.
