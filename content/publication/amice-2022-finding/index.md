abstract: ' Configuration space (C-space) has played a central role in collision-free
  motion planning, particularly for robot manipulators. While it is possible to check
  for collisions at a point using standard algorithms, to date no practical method
  exists for computing collision-free C-space regions with rigorous certificates due
  to the complexities of mapping task-space obstacles through the kinematics. In this
  work, we present the first to our knowledge method for generating such regions and
  certificates through convex optimization. Our method, called C-Iris (C-space Iterative
  Regional Inflation by Semidefinite programming), generates large, convex polytopes
  in a rational parametrization of the configuration space which are guaranteed to
  be collision-free. Such regions have been shown to be useful for both optimization-based
  and randomized motion planning. Our regions are generated by alternating between
  two convex optimization problems: (1) a simultaneous search for a maximal-volume
  ellipse inscribed in a given polytope and a certificate that the polytope is collision-free
  and (2) a maximal expansion of the polytope away from the ellipse which does not
  violate the certificate. The volume of the ellipse and size of the polytope are
  allowed to grow over several iterations while being collision-free by construction.
  Our method works in arbitrary dimensions, only makes assumptions about the convexity
  of the obstacles in the task space, and scales to realistic problems in manipulation.
  We demonstrate our algorithmâ€™s ability to fill a non-trivial amount of collision-free
  C-space in a 3-DOF example where the C-space can be visualized, as well as the scalability
  of our algorithm on a 7-DOF KUKA iiwa and a 12-DOF bimanual manipulator.'
