I am extremely passionate about teaching, particularly subjects that teach critical thinking such as programming and mathematics. Aside from the formal experiences below, I have tutored about dozen high school and undergraduate students in physics, chemistry, and introductory algebra, pre-calculus, trigonomotry and calculus.
