I am a third year PhD student in MIT's EECS Department advised by [Professor Pablo Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/) and [Professor Russ Tedrake](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html). I am broadly interested in optimal and efficient decision making especially for large scale or complex dynamical systems. I am particularly interested in exploiting polynomial and graph structure to obtain tractable algorithms for problems in control theory and certification. In addition to my research, I am an active contributor to [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/), an open-source simulator for model-based design and control of robots.
