  abstract={— In optimal control problems, disturbances are typically dealt with using robust solutions, such as H∞ or tube model predictive control, that plan control actions feasible for the worst-case disturbance. Yet, planning for every contingency can lead to over-conservative, poorly performing solutions or even, in extreme cases, to infeasibility. Resilience addresses these shortcomings by adapting the underlying control problem, e.g., by relaxing its specifications, to obtain a feasible, possibly still valuable trajectory. Despite their different aspects, robustness and resilience are often conflated in the context of dynamical systems and control. The goal of this paper is to formalize, in the context of optimal control, the concept of resilience understood as above, i.e., in terms of adaptation. To do so, we introduce a resilient formulation of optimal control by allowing disruption-dependent modifications of the requirements that induce the desired resilient behavior. We then propose a framework to design these behaviors automatically by trading off control performance and requirement violations. We analyze this resilience-by-compromise method to obtain inverse optimality results and quantify the effect of disturbances on the induced requirement relaxations. By proving that robustness and resilience optimize different objectives, we show that these are in fact distinct system properties. We conclude by illustrating the effect of resilience in different control problems.

  abstract={This work considers the problem of scheduling actuators to minimize the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) objective. In general, this problem is NP-hard and its solution can therefore only be approximated even for moderately large systems. Although convex relaxations have been used to obtain these approximations, they do not come with performance guarantees. Another common approach is to use greedy search. Still, classical guarantees do not hold for the scheduling problem because the LQR cost function is neither submodular nor supermodular. Though surrogate supermodular figures of merit, such as the log det of the controllability Gramian, are often used as a workaround, the resulting problem is not equivalent to the original LQR one. This work shows that no change to the original problem is needed to obtain performance guarantees. Specifically, it proves that the LQR cost function is approximately supermodular and provides new near-optimality certificates for the greedy minimization of these functions over a generic matroid. These certificates are shown to approach the classical 1/2 guarantee of supermodular functions in relevant application scenarios.

  abstract={ Configuration space (C-space) has played a central role in collision-free motion planning, particularly for robot manipulators. While it is possible to check for collisions at a point using standard algorithms, to date no practical method exists for computing collision-free C-space regions with rigorous certificates due to the complexities of mapping task-space obstacles through the kinematics. In this work, we present the first to our knowledge method for generating such regions and certificates through convex optimization. Our method, called C-Iris (C-space Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite programming), generates large, convex polytopes in a rational parametrization of the configuration space which are guaranteed to be collision-free. Such regions have been shown to be useful for both optimization-based and randomized motion planning. Our regions are generated by alternating between two convex optimization problems: (1) a simultaneous search for a maximal-volume ellipse inscribed in a given polytope and a certificate that the polytope is collision-free and (2) a maximal expansion of the polytope away from the ellipse which does not violate the certificate. The volume of the ellipse and size of the polytope are allowed to grow over several iterations while being collision-free by construction. Our method works in arbitrary dimensions, only makes assumptions about the convexity of the obstacles in the task space, and scales to realistic problems in manipulation. We demonstrate our algorithm’s ability to fill a non-trivial amount of collision-free C-space in a 3-DOF example where the C-space can be visualized, as well as the scalability of our algorithm on a 7-DOF KUKA iiwa and a 12-DOF bimanual manipulator.

  abstract={We study a general class of least-squares problems structured according to a partially ordered set (poset). This is a fundamental optimization problem underlying the design of structured controllers on directed acyclic graphs or posets. We show that the optimality conditions of this problem yield a structured linear system, with sparsity pattern determined by a derived poset known as the poset of intervals. In general, this system could be relatively dense, and thus standard sparse linear algebra techniques may fail to provide significant reduction in computational complexity. Nonetheless, for a broad class of posets called multitrees identified in (Nayyar 2015) we show that performing elimination according to an order defined by the poset intervals progressively decouples variables, reducing the arithmetic complexity of solving the problem.}

  abstract={The notion of approximate information states (AIS) was introduced in (Subramanian 2020) as a methodology for learning task-relevant state representations for control in partially observable systems. They proposed particular learning objectives which attempt to reconstruct the cost and next state and provide a bound on the suboptimality of the closed-loop performance, but it is unclear whether these bounds are tight or actually lead to good performance in practice.  Here we study this methodology by examining the special case of discrete approximate information states (DAIS). In this setting, we can solve for the globally optimal policy using value iteration for the DAIS model, allowing us to disambiguate the performance of the AIS objective from the policy search. Going further, for small problems with finite information states, we reformulate the DAIS learning problem as a novel mixed-integer program (MIP) and solve it to its global optimum; in the infinite information states case, we introduce clustering-based and end-to-end gradient-based optimization methods for minimizing the DAIS construction loss. We study DAIS in three partially observable environments and find that the AIS objective offers relatively loose bounds for guaranteeing monotonic performance improvement and is sufficient but not necessary for implementing optimal controllers. DAIS may even prove useful in practice by itself or as part of mixed discrete- and continuous-state representations, due to its ability to represent logical state, to its potential interpretabilty, and to the availability of these stronger algorithms.}
